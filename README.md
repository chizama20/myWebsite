# myWebsite

This repository showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through a fully functional website that highlights my abilities and projects. In the Projects section, you'll find a growing collection of work as I continue to expand my knowledge in software engineering. Some of the featured projects include:

Python Projects: A date scheduling tool, a BMI calculator, and an arithmetic calculator similar to the one on your phone.
Game Projects: A couple of games developed using Pygame.
C/C++ Projects: Additional side projects can be found on my GitHub, demonstrating my proficiency in C and C++.

Iâ€™m constantly adding more to keep growing as a developer, so check back often!
